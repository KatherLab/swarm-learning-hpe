The Swarm Learning client interface is provided as a python wheels package. It consists of Swarm Callback API and SWCI API.

-   Swarm Callback API - Python3 APIs for the following ML platforms - PyTorch and Keras \(based on TensorFlow 2 backend\). Swarm Callback is a custom callback class that consists of a set of functions that can be applied at various stages of the ML training process. For more information on Swarm Callback API usage, see [How to Swarm enable an ML algorithm](How_to_Swarm_enable_an_ML_algorithm.md).

-   SWCI API - A Python3 SWCI API to perform the SWCI operations programmatically. For more information, see [SWCI APIs](SWCI_APIs.md).
