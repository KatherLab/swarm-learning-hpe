HPE Swarm Learning is a decentralized, privacy-preserving Machine Learning \(ML\) framework. Swarm Learning framework utilizes the computing power at, or near, the distributed data sources to run the ML algorithms that train the models. It uses the security of a blockchain platform to share learnings with peers safely and securely. In Swarm Learning, training of the model occurs at the edge, where data is most recent, and where prompt, data-driven decisions are mostly necessary. In this completely decentralized architecture, only the insights learned are shared with the collaborating ML peers, not the raw data. This tremendously enhances data security and privacy.

There are various types of Swarm nodes - SN, SL, SWOP, and SWCI. For more information about the architecture of Swarm Learning, how these nodes work, how model training happens, see the *HPE Swarm Learning User Guide*.
