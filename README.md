Swarm learning learning and trails based on HPE platform

We now have a "Team Email": katherlab.swarm@gmail.com. With this we can log in to all swarm related things and use it in the code.

This repository contains:

1. SWARM Learning For Histopathology Image Analysis nad Radiology Image Analysis
2. [Work flow](https://github.com/users/Ultimate-Storm/projects/4) to help keep track of what's under process.
3. [Issue section](https://github.com/Ultimate-Storm/swarm-learning-hpe/issues) where people can dump ideas and raise
   questions encountered when using this repo.
4. Working version of mnist-pyt-gpu with automated scripts, tried on hosts 192.168.33.102 and 192.168.33.103

## Brief discription about HPE platform

Course of Swarm Leaning explained in a generally understandable
way: [https://learn.software.hpe.com/swarm-learning-essentials](https://learn.software.hpe.com/swarm-learning-essentials)

HPE Swarm Learning extends the **concept of federated learning** to **decentralized learning** by adding functionality
that **obviates the need for a central leader**. It combines the use of **AI**, **edge computing**, and **blockchain**.

HPE Swarm Learning is a **decentralized, privacy-preserving Machine Learning (ML) framework**. Swarm Learning framework
uses the computing power at, or near, the distributed data sources to run the ML algorithms that train the models. It
uses the security of a blockchain platform to share learning with peers safely and securely. In Swarm Learning, training
of the model occurs at the edge, where data is most recent, and where prompt, data-driven decisions are mostly
necessary. In this decentralized architecture, **only the insights learned are shared** with the collaborating ML peers,
not the raw data. This tremendously enhances data security and privacy.

The following image provides an overview of the Swarm Learning framework. Only the model parameters (learnings) are
exchanged between the various edge nodes and not the raw data. This ensures that the privacy of data is preserved.
