Swarm learning learning and trails based on HPE platform

We now have a "Team Email": katherlab.swarm@gmail.com. With this we can log in to all swarm related things and use it in the code.

This repository contains:

1. SWARM Learning For Histopathology Image Analysis nad Radiology Image Analysis
2. [Work flow](https://github.com/users/Ultimate-Storm/projects/4) to help keep track of what's under process.
3. [Issue section](https://github.com/Ultimate-Storm/swarm-learning-hpe/issues) where people can dump ideas and raise
   questions encountered when using this repo.
4. Working version of mnist-pyt-gpu with automated scripts, tried on hosts 192.168.33.102 and 192.168.33.103

## Background
### Brief discription about HPE platform

Course of Swarm Leaning explained in a generally understandable
way: [https://learn.software.hpe.com/swarm-learning-essentials](https://learn.software.hpe.com/swarm-learning-essentials)

HPE Swarm Learning extends the **concept of federated learning** to **decentralized learning** by adding functionality
that **obviates the need for a central leader**. It combines the use of **AI**, **edge computing**, and **blockchain**.

HPE Swarm Learning is a **decentralized, privacy-preserving Machine Learning (ML) framework**. Swarm Learning framework
uses the computing power at, or near, the distributed data sources to run the ML algorithms that train the models. It
uses the security of a blockchain platform to share learning with peers safely and securely. In Swarm Learning, training
of the model occurs at the edge, where data is most recent, and where prompt, data-driven decisions are mostly
necessary. In this decentralized architecture, **only the insights learned are shared** with the collaborating ML peers,
not the raw data. This tremendously enhances data security and privacy.

The following image provides an overview of the Swarm Learning framework. Only the model parameters (learnings) are
exchanged between the various edge nodes and not the raw data. This ensures that the privacy of data is preserved.

## Install
### Prerequisites
#### Hardware recommendations
* 64 GB of RAM (32 GB is the absolute minimum)
* 16 CPU cores (8 is the absolute minimum)
* an NVIDIA GPU with 48 GB of RAM (24 is the  minimum)
* 8 TB of Storage (4 TB is the absolute minimum)
* We deliberately want to show that we can work with lightweight hardware like this. Here are three quotes for systems like this for less than 10k EUR (Lambda, Dell Precision, and Dell Alienware)

#### Operating System
* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
  * We have tested the Swarm Learning Environment on [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS] and they work fine. 
  *  Any experimental release of Ubuntu greater than LTS 20.04 MAY result in unsuccessful swop node running.
  * It also works on wsl2 on Windows systems. But may have some issues with the docker installation.

### Setting up the user and repository
1. Create a user named "swarm" and add it to the sudoers group.
Login with user "swarm".
2. Run the following commands:

```sh
$ cd /
$ sudo mkdir opt/hpe
$ cd opt/hpe
$ sudo chmod 777 -R /opt/hpe
$ git clone https://github.com/KatherLab/swarm-learning-hpe.git
$ cd swarm-learning-hpe
$ git checkout dev_radiology
```
Requirements and dependencies will be automatically installed by the script mentioned in the following sction.


### Setting up the Swarm Learning Environment
**PLEASE REPLACE THE `<PLACEHOLDER>` WITH THE CORRESPONDING VALUE!**

`<sentinel_ip>` = `10.15.0.15` currently it's the IP assigned by VPN server for TUD host.

`<host_index>` = Your institute's name. For ODELIA project should be chosen from `TUD` `Ribera` `VHIO` `Radboud` `UKA` `Utrecht` `Mitera` `Cambridge` `Zurich`

`<workspace_name>` = The name of the workspace you want to work on. You can find available modules under `workspace/` folder. Each module corresonds to a radiology model. Currently we suggest to use `odelia-breast-mri` or `marogoto_mri` here.
1. `Prerequisite`: Runs scripts that check for required software and open/exposed ports.
```sh
$ sh workspace/automate_scripts/automate.sh -a
```
2. `Server setup`: Runs scripts that set up the swarm learning environment on a server.
```sh
$ sh workspace/automate_scripts/automate.sh -b -s <sentinel_ip> -d <host_index>
```
3. `Final setup`: Runs scripts that finalize the setup of the swarm learning environment. Only <> is required. The [-n num_peers] and [-e num_epochs] flags are optional.
```sh
$ sh workspace/automate_scripts/automate.sh -c -w <workspace_name> -s <sentinel_ip> -d <host_index> [-n num_peers] [-e num_epochs]
```

0. Optional: download preprocessed datasets. This will take a long time, could run it at any time. Just run with either command, get_dataset_gdown.sh without vpn, or get_dataset_scp.sh with vpn.
get_dataset_gdown.sh will download the dataset from Google Drive.
```sh
$ sh workspace/automate_scripts/sl_env_setup/get_dataset_gdown.sh
```
The [-s sentinel_ip] flag is only necessary for get_dataset_scp.sh The script will download the dataset from the sentinel node.
```sh
$ sh workspace/automate_scripts/sl_env_setup/get_dataset_scp.sh -s <sentinel_ip>
```

If problem encountered, please observe this [README.md](workspace%2Fautomate_scripts%2FREADME.md) file for step-by-step setup. Specific instructions are given about how to run the commands.
All the processes are automated, so you can just run the above command and wait for the process to finish.

If any problem occurs, please first try to figure out which step is going wrong, try to google for solutions and find solution in [Troubleshooting.md](Troubleshooting.md). Then contact the maintainer of the Swarm Learning Environment and document the error in the Troubleshooting.md file.

## Usage
### Running Swarm Learning Nodes
To run a Swarm Network node -> Swarm SWOP Node -> Swarm SWCI node. Please open a terminal for each of the nodes to run. Observe the following commands:
- To run a Swarm Network (or sentinel) node:
```sh
$ ./workspace/automate_scripts/launch_sl/run_sn.sh -s <sentinel_ip_address> -d <host_index>
```

- To run a Swarm SWOP node:
```sh
$ ./workspace/automate_scripts/launch_sl/run_swop.sh -w <workspace_name> -s <sentinel_ip_address>  -d <host_index>
```

- To run a Swarm SWCI node(SWCI node is used to generate training task runners, could be initiated by and host, but currently we suggest only the sentinel host is allowed to initiate):
```sh
$ ./workspace/automate_scripts/launch_sl/run_swci.sh -w <workspace_name> -s <sentinel_ip_address>  -d <host_index>
```

- To check the logs from training:
```sh
$ ./workspace/automate_scripts/launch_sl/check_latest_logs.sh
```

- To stop the Swarm Learning nodes, --[node_type] is optional, if not specified, all the nodes will be stopped. Otherwise, could specify --sn, --swop for example.
```sh
$ ./workspace/swarm_learning_scripts/stop-swarm --[node_type]
```

Please observe [Troubleshooting.md](Troubleshooting.md) section 10 for successful running logs of swop and sn nodes. The process will be keep running and displaying logs so you will need to open new terminal to run other commands.
