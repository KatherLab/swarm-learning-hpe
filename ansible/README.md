##Ansible

Ansible is an open-source configuration management, application deployment, and task automation tool. It uses an agentless architecture, which means it doesn't require any software to be installed on the managed nodes. Ansible uses SSH for communication and YAML for writing "playbooks," which define the desired state of the system and the tasks to be executed.
